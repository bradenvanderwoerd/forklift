# For a Raspberry Pi environment, some packages are best installed via apt
# to ensure compatibility with the system's libraries.
# It is highly recommended to run this command before using pip:
#
# sudo apt update
# sudo apt install -y python3-picamera2 python3-rpi.gpio python3-libcamera python3-numpy python3-opencv
#
# The packages listed below are the Python dependencies for this project.
# You can attempt to install them with 'pip install -r requirements.txt'
# after running the apt command above.
